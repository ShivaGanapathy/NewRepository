# Recycling Project Python Animation
I developed this animation for a school project in order to visually represent the process of Mixed Paper Recycling. The animation uses many libraries including numpy and pandas, and builds a GUI using pygame. Here is a basic walkthrough of the entire application: https://youtu.be/M4p0mlQJKOU

## main.py
This python file contains all the code required to run the application. Simply use the command python main.py to see the code in action. 

Note: this code base is currently in the process of getting refactored: much of the code in main.py wil likely be split into several different python files in the future.
